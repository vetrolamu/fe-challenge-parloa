# FE Challenge

## Running

- make sure you are using node version 22.11.0
- make sure you are using yarn version 1.22.22
- install dependencies `yarn`
- start the server: `yarn server`, server available at http://localhost:3003
- start the client: `yarn dev`, client available at http://localhost:5173
- start tests: `yarn test`, can see test output in the terminal

# Step 1: Prepare the data for the CandidateSummaryTable

In the `CandidatesView` component we are currently mocking the props being sent to the `CandidateSummaryTable`. Please help us figure out how to transform and aggregate the candidates data into the format we want to pass to the `CandidateSummaryTable`.

# Step 2

The client would like to be able to filter the candidates by profession. Please implement a feature so that when the user clicks on one of the professions listed in the CandidateSummaryTable, the candidates in the CandidatesList are filtered to only show candidates of the chosen profession.

### Step 3: Improve performance

The client informed us that they have to change the api to send all 50000 candidates at a time ðŸ¤¦
Go into `server/index.cjs` and update the `CANDIDATE_COUNT` variable to 50000 to simulate this.

This will cause the page to be slow and sluggish. Please look at where you can improve performance on the page to handle this volume of data.
